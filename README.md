# AwayFromOI.github.io
Created by a former OIer, this repo is intended for former competitive programmers to offer help to one another.
## How this project can help
- Providing links to resources
- Giving advice
- Sharing stories (Coming soon)

Note that as a student, what I can do to help is limited. Please ask your parents, teachers
or school psycologist for help. They may know more about the present situation and how to
deal with stress.

Do you have your own story? Do you want to give your own advice to those in need? [Open issues](https://github.com/awayfromoi/awayfromoi.github.io/issues), [Send a PR](https://github.com/awayfromoi/awayfromoi.github.io/pulls), or [Join us](https://github.com/awayfromoi).
## About competitive programming
Competitive programmers are those who compete by programming and solving problems. They are driven by their interest
as well as admission from college or job offer.

OI, Olympiad of Informatics, is a programming competition for high school students. In China, OI participants, known
as **OIers**, stop or reduce learning school subjects in order to get admitted into college in an alternative way.
**AFO**, short for **Away From OI**, is a term created by Chinese OIers, and the origin of the project name.

Though as shown in the project name, this project is mainly intended for Chinese OIers, it tries to reach participants
of other forms of competitive programming or from different countries.
## Why is help needed for former competitive programmers?
Competitive programmers take part in their work passionately, and some of them have been in love with computer technology since they
were very young. It's hard to accept that they have to quit competitive programming, to which they apply themseles.
To make things even work, they have to face stress from school subjects as well as their parents who may be disapproving because of
their failure. **As a result, they are subject to psycological problems.** Some became so desperate that they attempted or committed
suicide. I don't want such tragedy to reoccur, nor do I want to lose any of my fellow OIers.

Another difficulty comes from China's policy, which makes it a lot harder to enter good college by competition. Once they quite,
they need _more_ effort to enter college by school subjects. **Therefore, resources are needed to support them.**
