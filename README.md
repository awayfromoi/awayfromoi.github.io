# AwayfromOI
Have you been in love with computers since you were young?

Have you taken an active part in competitive programming, and finally 
realized that you have to quit?

I do understand that being away from competitive programming is significant loss. To make things worse, you may have to face a lot of stress from classes and disapproving parents. If this is the case, you are subject to psycological problems.

Please, do remember that you are mot alone. I'm here to help you.
# 退出OI
你是否从小就深爱着计算机？

你是否投身于信息竞赛，最终却发现自己不得不离开？

我理解 AFO 意味着失去很多。更糟糕的是，你可能需要应对大量的课业压力和反对的家长。在这种情况下，你很容易遭遇心理问题。

请记住，你不是一个人。我会在这帮助你。
