# AwayFromOI.github.io
A repo meant to provide help resources for those who have just quitted competitive programming.
## Why is help needed for former competitive programmers?
Competitive programmers are those who code and solve problems to compete in competitions. They are driven by both their interest and admission from college, job offer, etc., which are given to them if they are successful.

Competitive programmers take part in their work passionately, and some of them have been in love with computer technology since they were very young. It's hard to accept that they have to quit competitive programming, into which they apply themseles into.
To make things even work, they have to face stress from school subjects as well as their parents who may be disapproving because of their failure. **As a result, they are subject to psycological problems.** Some of them became so desperate that they killed themselves! I don't want such tragedy to reoccur, nor do I want to lose any of my fellow OIers.

Another difficulty comes from China's policy, which makes it a lot harder to enter good college by competition. They need _more_ effort to enter college by school subjects. **Therefore, resources are needed to support them.**
